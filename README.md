## üß© Abstract

Behavior-based Driver Identification is a significant problem that aims to identify drivers based on their unique driving behaviors. This has numerous applications, including preventing vehicle theft and enhancing personalized driving experiences. While previous studies have shown that Deep Learning approaches can achieve high performance, considerable challenges remain. A key issue is that most studies are conducted offline, rather than directly on vehicles. For real-world applications, models installed in cars must be capable of adapting to new drivers while minimizing resource consumption. Continual Learning techniques, which allow models to learn new driving behaviors while retaining previously acquired knowledge, offer a promising solution to this challenge.

This study addresses the Driver Identification problem in a realistic setting, where the model must adapt to new drivers. We evaluate the performance of various Continual Learning techniques across multiple scenarios with increasing complexity and realistic applicability. Furthermore, given the temporal correlation inherent in this setting, we propose a novel technique called SmooDER. The effectiveness and superiority of our method are validated using the well-known OCSLab dataset.
